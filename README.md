## DESCRIPTION

"What's Cookin'?" is a group project completed as a part of Module 2 at Turing School of Software Design's Front-End curriculum. The application hosts a variety of recipes that can be viewed as a whole, by course (salads, hor d'oevres, main courses, sides), or searched by a tag or recipe name to show relevent recipes. When looking at a recipe's page that recipe can be saved to the users saved recipes page. When looking at the saved recipe collection the user may search through their recipes and delete recipes of their choosing.

## LEARNING GOALS

- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation

- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Make network requests to retrieve data
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.
- Understand the use of new technologies introduced in this project:
  -  WebPack
  -  Fetch API
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Follow best practices for accessibility
- Implement feedback from a usability test to improve product
